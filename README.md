### ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

```javascript
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=auth_domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=storage_bucket
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=app_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=measurement_id
```

**Step 6: Start the Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```
This command will start the Next.js development server, and your project will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. You can access your web app from a web browser to see the results.

These steps will guide you from cloning the repository to running your Next.js project with Firebase authentication. Make sure to replace placeholder values with your actual project-specific information.
